# How To Takes Notes (by Dr. Jubbal)

How to take notes by Dr. Kevin Jubbal from [Med School Insider](https://youtu.be/QUndnWBR0A0) on youtube.

## The purpose of taking notes

This may seems obvious, but it's a foundational questions.

You **should't taking notes to copy verbatim from the Professor** (or any other sources) to the textbook. Rather, notes are a tool to facilitate comprehention, memorization, and more effective studying methods. That's not the main purpose of taking notes.

Instead think note-taking as 2 discrete steps:

- Process Function ✍️
  This is the function where we can copying or understanding by taking the notes and stuffs.

- Product Function 🤔
  And this is the function where we can review our own notes in the future and commit facts to memory through rehersal, etc.

## What devices we should use to taking the notes?

With Classic Notepad 📝 (with paper)?

Or

With Computer 💻 or any other digital stuff?

So let's take a look with Dr. Jubbal explanation that I've convert into this table

|                 | Classics 📝                          | Computer 💻 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Writing         | ✅                                   | ✅          |
| Drawing         | ✅                                   | ❌          |
| Images          | ❌ (You can but need to print first) | ✅          |
| Store Digitally | ❌                                   | ✅          |
| Quick Search    | ❌                                   | ✅          |

According to some Scientific Journal and Research Article

- Mueller and Oppenheimer in 2014; The Pen Is Mightier Than The Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking

Typing notes on laptop is more likely to result in transcribing lectures verbatim rather than deeper information processing and reframing into one's own word.

So for Mueller and Oppenheimer:

```
Classics 📝 > Computer 💻
```

- Dung and collagues in 2012; Note-taking with computers: Exploring alternative strategies for improve recall

Found an opposing results, participants could study their notes, those who used computer to transcribe the lectures performed the best on delayed recall tests.

- Fiorella and Mayer in 2017; Spontaneous spatial strategy use in learning from scientific text

Also found a similar result with Dung, those who used a laptop performed better on factual information recall than those who took notes by hand, those taking longhand notes experience greater extra cognitive processing which is, ultimately a distraction.

Which is better? confusing right?

So, this is 3 key no matter what you use,

- Eliminate Distractions 🔇
- Avoid Transcribing 🗣️
- Take Advantage of Images & Figures 🖼️

And last **use tablet** 📱, it provides you more options, you can use it to took a photo, draw something, and even annotate from a PDF.

## How we do note-taking most effectively

There are several format on how to take notes effectively

### Cornell Format

There is a Cornell format as this shown image below

![Cornell Format](/attachment/Clipboard_2023-06-30-19-16-51.png)

However this format isn't very useful since there's only plenty space to draw and imagine things. And also the summary is so small. Dr. Jubbal also don't recommend this format.

### The Outline Method

It just simple to be honest, just like this

- Main Topic
  - Subtopic
    - Supporting Idea
    - Supporting Idea
  - Subtopic
    - Supporting Idea

And just like that more than before. And the craziest part, I actually used this method even before I learn this.

he only disadvantage from this method is Easy to misuse, but personally, it just shows how deep our knowledge when we not misuse this method.

## Note Interacting & Reflecting

Once we've taken the notes, the key of learning the information **isn't simply review your notes again and again**.

Rather, you need to practice forms of **active learning** 🤔💭. In determining the method to use, consider what makes the coursework challenging.

### Fact Heavy or Concept Heavy

Most subjects are **Fact Heavy** or **Concept Heavy**.

![Fact Heavy or Concept heavy](/attachment/Clipboard_2023-06-30-17-52-38.png)

Fact heavy examples:

- History 👴
- Psychology 🔮

Concept heavy examples:

- Math ✖️🟰
- Calculus ➗

So after determine the subject, you can use:

- Synthesis Questions for Fact Heavy
- Create summary sheets for Concept heavy

## Summary: How Do You Really Taking Notes When Learning?

1. Remove distractions 🔇
2. Avoid transcribing 🗣️
3. Use images and figures 🖼️
4. Use a tablet 📱
   - Or you can find any other alternative
5. Use the outline method 📝
6. Fact or concept heavy? 🤔
   - Synthesis questions (Fact heavy)
   - Create summary sheets (Concept heavy)
